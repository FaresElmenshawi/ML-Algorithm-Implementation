# ML-Algorithm-Implementation

This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of popular machine learning algorithms, implemented entirely from scratch in Python. The code is easy-to-read, well-commented, and accessible for both beginners and advanced users. 

The algorithms included cover a wide range of applications and include:
- Supervised Learning techniques
- Unsupervised Learning techniques
- Reinforcement Learning techniques

Each algorithm is accompanied by an in-depth explanation of the theory behind it and a practical example of its usage. The repository also includes a set of interactive Jupyter notebooks, which allow for easy exploration of the code and understanding of the algorithms.

Whether you're just getting started with machine learning or looking to deepen your understanding of the underlying principles, this repository is designed to be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the field.
